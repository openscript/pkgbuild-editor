# pkgbuild-editor

Your all-in-one code-based parser and editor for seamless [PKGBUILD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD) file handling.

## About

When managing the Arch User Repository (AUR), precise control over `PKGBUILD` files from code is essential, when you want to automate things. `pkgbuild-editor` provides a powerful parser and editor, transforming `PKGBUILD` handling into a streamlined experience.
